            <h2>Welcome to My Golf Guide</h2>
            <p>This website is for golfers who want to understand equipment better and get the most out of club fittings. I'm Josh from Rapid City, South Dakota—golf is one of my biggest passions, and I love how analytics combine with personal feel to make real improvements on the course.</p>

            <h2>Why Fittings Matter</h2>
            <p>Many players buy clubs off the rack and never get fitted. This can lead to inconsistent shots, shorter distance, or even bad habits. A good fitting uses data to match clubs to your swing—resulting in better accuracy and lower scores. Whether you're hitting courses in the Black Hills or just practicing locally, the right equipment makes a huge difference.</p>
